Once differentially expressed genes are identified, enrichment analysis (EA) methods can be conducted to identify groups of genes (e.g. particular pathways) that are differentially expressed, and offer insights into biological mechanisms. One example of such a method is the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which is frequently used for high-throughput gene expression data analysis. This course will cover GSEA and alternative enrichment tools. Because most of their implementations are directly linked to databases that annotate the function of genes in the cell, the course will also give an overview of functional annotation databases such as the Gene Ontology. Learning outcomes At the end of the course, the participants will be able to: Distinguish available enrichment analysis methods Apply GSEA and over-representation analysis using R Determine whether the genes of a GO term have a statistically significant difference in expression or not Learn where to find other gene sets in databases (e.g. KEGG, oncogenic gene sets) and use them in R Exercises The course is divided into small blocks, each with a lecture and relevant practical exercises. We will comment the practical exercises at the end of each block. Asking questions During lectures, you are encouraged to ask questions. Just unmute yourself and ask your questions or use the Zoom functionality.

We will explain the code during practicals. Source of data We will work with RNA sequencing data generated by Ercolano et al 2020 . This study was a descriptive study of immune cells that are circulating in the blood of humans in healthy conditions. Different types of immune cells circulate in human blood. The goal of this study was to determine differences in transcriptomes between 2 cell types, Natural Killer (NK) cells and CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. These 2 types of cells have different functions: NK cells provide a rapid response in the innate immune response at the beginning of an infection such as by a virus, and are able to kill virus-infected cells by secreting cytotoxic molecules; Th cells have an important role in the adaptive immune response by aiding antigen-presenting cells by secreting different panels of cytokines depending on the type of pathogen infecting the host. The RNA sequencing data that we provide includes the results of a differential gene expression analysis comparing NK cells to Th cells. The differential gene expression analysis was performed using limma (see Links page).
